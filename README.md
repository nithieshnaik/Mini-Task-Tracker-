# Mini Task Tracker

Mini Task Tracker is a web application that allows users to manage tasks with secure user authentication. The project is divided into two main components:

1. **Backend**: Built using NestJS, handles user authentication, task management, and database interactions.
2. **Frontend**: Built using Vue.js, provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login using email and password.
- **Task Management**: Users can create, update, delete, and view tasks.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is designed to work well on various devices.
- **API Integration**: The frontend interacts with the backend through RESTful APIs.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used for storing user and task data.
- **gRPC Microservices**: Integrates with microservices using gRPC in the backend.
